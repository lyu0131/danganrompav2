			<h2>Character Concept</h2>
			<p>From the planning stages it was decided that Makoto should not have much individuality, which made him difficult for character designer Rui Komatsuzaki to design compared to the other characters whose designs were more unique and distinct. Because the game was initially planned to be played from a third-person perspective from behind Makoto, he was designed wearing a hoodie with a distinctive decal on the hood to give players something to look at. His ahoge was added to give his hair some character, and he was deliberately made shorter than the other male characters in order to give him a 'herbivore man'-type image. His color scheme, though plain, were chosen because they were colors that Komatsuzaki particularly liked.</p>
